This is the first page I've created from scratch using HTML and CSS.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum,](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css) I attempted to visually recreate the google homepage. I think this turned out pretty well, though I wasn't so thorough as to color-match, I instead stuck to standard named colors.

It's too bad that centering things isn't as simple as an HTML \<center>\ tag, because laying things out using CSS was definitely the most difficult part of this exercise. Also worth noting that width + padding can make things a little wider than expected without box-sizing.

And I completely forgot to use git since I did this in one go!
